# Tech
I used it to learn some React as I go. Tech stack used:
* React
* SASS

# What I learned
I practiced how to work with custom components, how to style them, how to structure my project. I decided to keep several css files, one per component and one for the whole project. I also learned how to deploy React apps to Netflify (I imagined it would be different from static HTML/CSS sites, but no! It's really straightforward).
I've also used developer mode in Figma for the first time. It's a big improvement, speeds up styling and overall it's a very useful feature. I'll definitely use it in the future.
